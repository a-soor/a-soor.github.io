## Arun Soor's Webpage

I am a DPhil (Maths) student at in the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford. 

My supervisor is Prof. Konstantin Ardakov. 

I did my BA and MMath at Oxford. My part C dissertation "Crystal Graphs and the representation theory of the symmetric group" was supervised by Prof. Kevin McGerty.

I am interested in representations arising from the cohomology of modular curves, and using geometric representation theory to understand them.
