## Arun Soor's Webpage

I am a DPhil (Maths) student at in the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford.

My supervisor is Prof. Konstantin Ardakov. I am interested in representations arising from the cohomology of modular curves, and using geometric representation theory to understand them.

I did my BA and MMath at Oxford. My part C dissertation "Crystal Graphs and the representation theory of the symmetric group" was supervised by Prof. Kevin McGerty.
